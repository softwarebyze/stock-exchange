# Stock Exchange

This project is a web application that allows users to search for stocks listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The app features a scrolling stock ticker at the top of the page, a search form for users to input a stock symbol or company name, and a company page with a chart showing the stock's price history. The app makes use of the Financial Modeling Prep API to retrieve stock data.
